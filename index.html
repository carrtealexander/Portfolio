            <h3>About Me </h3>
            <p>"Future" Software Egineer</p>
            <p> So, about me. I'm 28 going on thirty. I have 2 kids and engaged. I work a ton and have little to know free time (thats code for don't have kids). <br>
                As a ki I always wanted to be a software engineer I just didn't know it. I always had a notebook of games I wanted to make and was always into tech. I just didn't know <br>
                 I didn't know I could go to school for it and all the avenues I could take. I didnt know how to get there. Now i'm getting old and its time to teach this old dog <br>
                  some new tricks. I'm a pretty fast learner and I appreciate failing. Appreciate failing,<strong>what does that mean?</strong> It means I failed so many times  <br>
                   and found I always bounce back and for the most part I learn form it and improve x 2. I'm getting the hint that I'm going to fail a couple <br>
                    times a day in this idustry.I'm slowly grasping the concepts and all that yatta yatta terminology but every day it feels less and less like rocket science. <br>
                    Which in my eyes is a step in the right direction. I may not be there yet. But im cofindent <strong>I will get there someway, somehow.</strong>
